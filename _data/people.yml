  bio: After a multi-year hiatus of zoom birthdays and remote happy hours, nationally-recognized security speaker Ariel Robinson is back on the circuit with a host of new talks, trainings, and pandemic puppy pics. (He was planned before the pandemic, okay?) With an academic background in cognitive science and linguistics, Ariel has built a career out of using pictures and small words to translate highly technical concepts between vastly different stakeholders (most of whom have little in common besides appearing vaguely humanoid). Ariel's work has brought her face-to-face with some of society's most dangerous members, from Marines, to lawyers, to seven year old's at a birthday party after cake. Outside of her current role as a senior security product manager, Ariel draws, paints, and climbs really big rocks.
