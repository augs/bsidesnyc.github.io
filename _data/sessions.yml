  title: "Analyzing volatile memory on a Google Kubernetes Engine node"
  description: "My talk focuses on how we can access and analyze volatile memory in the kernel on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) node using AVML. The purpose of this is to collect a memory snapshot to get granular information about running processes and activities on the GKE node as well as pods and containers running on that node. By using the memory snapshot we can troubleshoot current node activities or use it to collect additional information as part of a security investigation. I will also cover how this method is applicable to other cloud instances running Linux distributions that are supported by AVML."

  title: "Low Code High Risk: Enterprise Domination via Low Code Abuse"
  description: "Why focus on heavily guarded crown jewels when you can dominate an organization through its shadow IT?
Low-Code applications have become a reality in the enterprise, with surveys showing that most enterprise apps are now built outside of IT, with lacking security practices. Unsurprisingly, attackers have figured out ways to leverage these platforms for their gain.

In this talk, we demonstrate a host of attack techniques found in the wild, where enterprise No-Code platforms are leveraged and abused for every step in the cyber killchain. You will learn how attackers perform an account takeover by making the user simply click a link, move laterally and escalate privileges with zero network traffic, leave behind an untraceable backdoor, and automate data exfiltration, to name a few capabilities. All capabilities will be demonstrated with POCs, and their source code will be shared.

Next, we will drop two isolation-breaking vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and cross-tenant access. We will explain how these vulnerabilities were discovered and assess their pre-discovery impact.

Finally, we will introduce an open-source recon tool that identifies opportunities for lateral movement and privilege escalation through low-code platforms."

  description: "We’ll demonstrate several hacks against xIoT, or Extended Internet of Things, devices. For those who would say, “But they’re just security cameras monitoring the parking garage, wireless access points in the cafeteria, or PLCs controlling robotic welding arms; what harm can they cause?” - this will illuminate that harm. We’ll share stories from the trenches involving cybercriminals, nation-state actors, and defenders. Our presentation will detail findings from over six years of xIoT threat research spanning millions of production devices in enterprises and government agencies around the world. We’ll identify various steps organizations can take to mitigate risk while embracing a Things-connected world."

  title: "Hacking Serverless Applications: A Treasure Map for Uncharted Waters"
  description: "Serverless technology eliminates the need for development teams to provision servers, passing the responsibility for some security threats to the cloud provider and freeing-up developers to concentrate on building logic and producing value quickly. But even without servers, serverless functions still execute code, which can lead to a cloud disaster, if not done right.

In this talk, we will discuss common risks and challenges in serverless environments. I will introduce techniques used by attackers to exploit Serverless apps in unconventional ways. I will also demonstrate exploits of recently discovered CVE, targeting cloud functions."

  description: "DLL Hijacking, a well-known technique for executing malicious payloads via trusted executables, has been scrutinised extensively, to the point where defenses are in a much better position to detect malicious use. In this presentation, we take a closer look at how process-level Environment Variables can be abused for taking over legitimate applications.Taking a systemic approach, we demonstrate that 80+ Windows-native executables are vulnerable to this special type of DLL Hijacking. As this raises opportunities for UAC bypass and Privilege Escalation, we discuss the value and further implications of this technique. We also look at preventative/defensive measures, especially for this type of DLL Hijacking, but also for DLL Hijacking more broadly."

Fears of vulnerabilities in the software supply chain  have accelerated demands for SBOMs by customers. This presentation will explain what an SBOM is, who is asking for them, what they are going to do with them, the standard formats in which they are issued, and how to generate them. It will also describe how SBOMs fit into vulnerability disclosure and remediation processes and add transparency to the software supply chain. "

Trusted Types, a browser-level runtime defense against dangerous DOM sink API usages, is currently the best defense we have against large classes of DOM XSS, but has a reputation for being difficult to deploy (even more difficult than Content Security Policy). We will talk about the philosophy and the journey behind how we scaled Trusted Types rollouts across hundreds of webapps and billions of users at Google and the current challenges for wider adoption of defenses against DOM XSS in the ecosystem."

  description: "Critical SOC KPIs?  MTTD.  MTTR.  Right? 
Except… “Detect” starts from compromise? Or Alert? 
One “expert” says “Respond” means “time to resolve an incident” but defines neither “resolve” nor “incident.” 
Time-To- Qualify?  Identify?  Triage?  Contain?  Resolve?  Recover?  
I run SOC/CIRT for a F500. My vendors all use different words. Metrics don’t align. It’s ridiculous. I’ve tabulated 30+ sources and… no one has a frickin’ clue.
We need a common language, like ATT&CK gives TTPs.  If “a problem well-defined is half-solved” we’re doing a crap job solving this. EVERYONE’S Security suffers as a result. I’ve diagramed one possible solution as a conversation-starter."

  description: "Many cyber environments have different capabilities, but they can be siloed and specific. Having an intelligence focused program isn’t always a feasible solution. In this talk we will be taking two important functional areas, Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management, and exploring how both programs can benefit and build each other’s defenses. 

By using threat intelligence to provide vital context to vulnerabilities, you will not only better understand the likelihood of being exploited, but you will also have a stronger understanding of your environment to enable timely decisions. This talk benefits everyone from analyst to C-level decision maker."

  description: 'Identifying adversary behaviors that matter to your organization has always been a difficult task. The purpose of this talk is to help close that gap by exploring adversary behaviors communicated through MITRE ATT&CK and Tidal Cyber. Traditionally, teams have had to wade through large volumes of unstructured CTI to surface the most relevant groups, software, or campaigns, adding so much time that the exercise becomes prohibitive. We will demo and show how structured metadata around threats, such as motivations, sectors, and victim locations unlocks achievable "threat profiling", and how pivoting to relevant techniques, procedures, defenses, and tests allows teams to take action in line with their unique profile.'
