  title: "Analyzing volatile memory on a Google Kubernetes Engine node"
  description: "My talk focuses on how we can access and analyze volatile memory in the kernel on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) node using AVML. The purpose of this is to collect a memory snapshot to get granular information about running processes and activities on the GKE node as well as pods and containers running on that node. By using the memory snapshot we can troubleshoot current node activities or use it to collect additional information as part of a security investigation. I will also cover how this method is applicable to other cloud instances running Linux distributions that are supported by AVML."

  title: "Low Code High Risk: Enterprise Domination via Low Code Abuse"
  description: "Why focus on heavily guarded crown jewels when you can dominate an organization through its shadow IT?
Low-Code applications have become a reality in the enterprise, with surveys showing that most enterprise apps are now built outside of IT, with lacking security practices. Unsurprisingly, attackers have figured out ways to leverage these platforms for their gain.

In this talk, we demonstrate a host of attack techniques found in the wild, where enterprise No-Code platforms are leveraged and abused for every step in the cyber killchain. You will learn how attackers perform an account takeover by making the user simply click a link, move laterally and escalate privileges with zero network traffic, leave behind an untraceable backdoor, and automate data exfiltration, to name a few capabilities. All capabilities will be demonstrated with POCs, and their source code will be shared.

Next, we will drop two isolation-breaking vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and cross-tenant access. We will explain how these vulnerabilities were discovered and assess their pre-discovery impact.

Finally, we will introduce an open-source recon tool that identifies opportunities for lateral movement and privilege escalation through low-code platforms."

  title: "xIoT Hacking Demonstrations & Strategies to Disappoint Bad Actors"
  description: "We’ll demonstrate several hacks against xIoT, or Extended Internet of Things, devices. For those who would say, “But they’re just security cameras monitoring the parking garage, wireless access points in the cafeteria, or PLCs controlling robotic welding arms; what harm can they cause?” - this will illuminate that harm. We’ll share stories from the trenches involving cybercriminals, nation-state actors, and defenders. Our presentation will detail findings from over six years of xIoT threat research spanning millions of production devices in enterprises and government agencies around the world. We’ll identify various steps organizations can take to mitigate risk while embracing a Things-connected world."

  title: "Pen Testing for NOT Dummies"
  description: "Penetration testing is vital to cybersecurity defenses, but safeguarding your systems isn’t easy. Methodologies include automated, continuous, and manual pen tests. How do you ensure that you pick the right solution to meet your needs? I will draw on my 2+ decades of experience and discuss the complexities, techniques, and limitations of pen testing, and how to understand what and how to test."

  title: "Hacking Serverless Applications: A Treasure Map for Uncharted Waters"
  description: "Serverless technology eliminates the need for development teams to provision servers, passing the responsibility for some security threats to the cloud provider and freeing-up developers to concentrate on building logic and producing value quickly. But even without servers, serverless functions still execute code, which can lead to a cloud disaster, if not done right.

In this talk, we will discuss common risks and challenges in serverless environments. I will introduce techniques used by attackers to exploit Serverless apps in unconventional ways. I will also demonstrate exploits of recently discovered CVE, targeting cloud functions."

  title: "Infrastructure as Remote Code Execution: How to abuse Terraform to elevate access"
  description: "This talk will focus on ways to abuse the use of Terraform to elevate privileges, expose data, and gain further footholds in environments from a developer's perspective. We'll cover the common uses of Terraform and how a malicious actor could abuse Terraform and even bypass security controls to execute unapproved code. This talk will include multiple demos of ways to exploit Terraform cloud."

  title: "Save the Environment (Variable): Hijacking Legitimate Applications with a Minimal Footprint"
  description: "DLL Hijacking, a well-known technique for executing malicious payloads via trusted executables, has been scrutinised extensively, to the point where defenses are in a much better position to detect malicious use. In this presentation, we take a closer look at how process-level Environment Variables can be abused for taking over legitimate applications.Taking a systemic approach, we demonstrate that 80+ Windows-native executables are vulnerable to this special type of DLL Hijacking. As this raises opportunities for UAC bypass and Privilege Escalation, we discuss the value and further implications of this technique. We also look at preventative/defensive measures, especially for this type of DLL Hijacking, but also for DLL Hijacking more broadly."

  description: "In a post-mortem analysis of Trickbot/Conti gangs, I'll detail our unique view into their operations, methods, and lives. Real time access to Conti Leaks was just one of many tools in our arsenal. Our work and unique vantage point has prevented a significant portion of the gang’s crimes. This story is about our journey, process, and insights into one of the most notorious cybergangs of our time."

  title: "Is Machete dead or alive? A resurrection in pandemic times"
  description: >
    While living in Ecuador, I discovered Ragua by myself. I manually found the very first sample in a military facility in Quito, and I called it "Machete." Team "Lechuzas" (crew name) behind Machete was active for a while until they got too exposed. So they disappeared. During COVID, Machete returned and went wild, running offensive cyber-mercenaries operations targeting Prosecutors' Offices and other Governments Institutions in Latin America. It received funds from the highest bidder and built fake Websites exposing stolen sensitive information for public opinion manipulation. But when enough is enough? Machete also went Ransomware. This presentation will provide historical context on Machete along with the latest Ops and its IOCs, Detection Rules, and TTPs.

  title: "Broken links - Behind the scenes of Supply Chain breaches"
  description: "Supply Chain attacks are all over the news as several high profile breaches highlight CI/CD pipelines as a prime target. The supply chain links the developer’s laptop, via the SCM, through CI/CD and finally the running application in production.

We’ve all heard about the SolarWinds breach, but what can be done to prevent such an attack? In this talk, we dive behind the scenes of similar attacks through the lens of SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts), a threat model designed to tackle these emergent threats."

  description: "In a world where complex JavaScript clientside code is the norm, defending against DOM XSS remains a top priority for developers and organizations. Trusted Types, a browser-level runtime defense against dangerous DOM sink API usages, is currently the best defense we have against large classes of DOM XSS, but has a reputation for being difficult to deploy (even more difficult than Content Security Policy). We will talk about the philosophy and the journey behind how we scaled Trusted Types rollouts across hundreds of webapps and billions of users at Google and the current challenges for wider adoption of defenses against DOM XSS in the ecosystem."

  title: "The Metrics Mess: Why the Lack of Clear and Common KPIs is Undermining SecOps (and How We Can Fix It)"
  description: "Critical SOC KPIs?  MTTD.  MTTR.  Right? 
Except… “Detect” starts from compromise? Or Alert? 
One “expert” says “Respond” means “time to resolve an incident” but defines neither “resolve” nor “incident.” 
Time-To- Qualify?  Identify?  Triage?  Contain?  Resolve?  Recover?  
I run SOC/CIRT for a F500. My vendors all use different words. Metrics don’t align. It’s ridiculous. I’ve tabulated 30+ sources and… no one has a frickin’ clue.
We need a common language, like ATT&CK gives TTPs.  If “a problem well-defined is half-solved” we’re doing a crap job solving this. EVERYONE’S Security suffers as a result. I’ve diagramed one possible solution as a conversation-starter."

  title: "The Intersection of Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management"
  description: "Many cyber environments have different capabilities, but they can be siloed and specific. Having an intelligence focused program isn’t always a feasible solution. In this talk we will be taking two important functional areas, Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management, and exploring how both programs can benefit and build each other’s defenses. 

By using threat intelligence to provide vital context to vulnerabilities, you will not only better understand the likelihood of being exploited, but you will also have a stronger understanding of your environment to enable timely decisions. This talk benefits everyone from analyst to C-level decision maker."
